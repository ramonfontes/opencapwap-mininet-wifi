HOW TO BUILD AND RUN CAPWAP FOR LINUX SYSTEMS:

NOTE: To run WTP you must have a wireless card with AP mode (check with iw)

HOW TO BUILD AC AND WTP:

  - Enter into "capwap" directory
  - Run "make clean"
  - Run "make"

Required:
	libnl-3-dev
	libnl-3-genl
	libssl-dev
	
HOW TO RUN WTP:

	- Open a shell in superuser mode
	- Be sure that your wireless card is working
	- Be sure that the wireless card you want to use as Access Point hasn't any active wireless interface (delete all wlanX)
	- In file settings.wtp.txt you have to put the phy name of your wireless card (use iw):
		<RADIO_PHY_TOT>1
		<RADIO_PHY_NAME_0>phy2
    	- Open the file "config.wtp" and write the AC IP-address between <AC_ADDRESSES> and </AC_ADDRESSES> tags
	- Run "./WTP" in superuser mode
	- In LocalMAC mode, you need to bridge the master interface with your ethernet port or setting the route with ip command

HOW TO RUN AC (32-bit OS recommended):
	
	- Open a shell in superuser mode
	- Run "./AC" in superuser mode
	- Create a bridge between AC_tap interface and eth0 using a script like this:
		dhclient -r bridgeAC
		brctl addbr bridgeAC
		brctl addif bridgeAC AC_tap
		brctl addif bridgeAC eth0
		ifconfig bridgeAC up
		ifconfig AC_tap up
		ifconfig eth0 0
		ifconfig AC_tap 0
		dhclient bridgeAC

HOW TO CREATE AN Access Point Interface ON WTP SIDE:
	- Enter into the "wum" folder and run "make"
	- Run: ./wum -c wtps if you want to know all WTPs associated with your AC
	- Run: ./wum -c addwlan -w <WTP_ID> -r 1 -l 1 -s <SSID> -t 1

// -------------- 
N.B.
OpenCAPWAP doesn't provide any type of dhcp service or IP assignation to associated stations, i.e. you must have a dhcp server active. When a client station associates with the WTP AP interface, it starts to send DHCP Discovery messages.
If you are using the SPLIT MAC mode, you must create a bridge between AC's network interface (ethernet or wireless) and the AC's tap interface.
If you are using the LOCAL MAC mode, you must create a bridge between the WTP's AP interface and the ethernet interface.
The DHCP server must be reachable from WTP's ethernet (LOCAL MAC) or AC's ethernet (SPLIT MAC).
// -------------- 

To set WTP and AC options edit the "config.wtp" and "config.ac" files and restart applications.
